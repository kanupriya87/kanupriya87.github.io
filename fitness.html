    <h1>Bollywood meets ZUMBA!</h1>
    <h3>What is Zumba? </h3>
    <p>Zumba is a dance fitness program which involves dance and aerobic movements performed to energetic music. The exercises include music with fast and slow rhythms, as well as resistance training. The choreography incorporates hip-hop, soca, samba, salsa, merengue and mambo. Squats and lunges are also included.</p>
    <p>Zumba is an incredible way to build cardiovascular strength, gain flexibility, and build muscle.  It is also one of the most effective exercises that result in long sustaining and healthfully attained weight loss.  But Zumba has many more life sustaining, health building, and mental strengthening qualities than just losing weight and looking great.<p>
